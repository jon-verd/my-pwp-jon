        Launch Animation: This is a temporary page that will act as the introduction. My inspiration for this comes from https://olunkwa.studio/. What I'm aiming for is an animation that will introduce me by name and then open up to my main site. The center of attention for this page will be my name and maybe a dot (or other simple shape). The animation will start in the middle of the page and then end at the top. When the animation is complete, the elements will stay at the top of the page. My ideal font would be Helvetica Neue Black but it is too expensive. Instead, I've opted for Biryani because it is similar (modern, sans serif and easy to read).

        Buttons/Dots/Animations: The top left button could have the additional functionality of refreshing the page. This is important to me because I plan on the introductory animation happening automatically and relatively quickly (and I like watching the animation). It could also be a hexagon. The buttons on the right correspond to links to GitHub, Linkedin and my Resume respectively. In the future I could add more links to other websites or projects. They will have a few interesting properties, most notably a preview of the link will appear in the box where my bio is (main page) and the rest of the page will be blurred (still unsure about the blurr effect). Basically I would like the space to be where all the content appears (and disappears) so that the readers focus is concentrated on a single part of the page.

        Single/Main page: This page has my jumbotron greeting, intro, bio and links to outside sources (buttons) as described in the previous paragraph. My ethos for the personal website is to design a site that is simple, functional and modern. It may be hard to showcase my talent with such a simple site so Im hoping the animation will make a good impression. Also, the color palette Ive chosen is: #4B5980  #808080 #E6E6E6 #000000 (but this could change.)
